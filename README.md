# APS1052Project---Computational Methods in Finance

This project implements and compares portfolio optimization and risk management methods using Python. The work combines optimization techniques, Monte Carlo simulation, and data visualization to evaluate investment strategies.

## Methods
- Portfolio optimization:
  - Mean-Variance Optimization (MVO)
  - Robust Mean-Variance Optimization
  - Risk Parity Allocation
- Risk analysis:
  - Monte Carlo simulation of portfolio returns
  - Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Conditional VaR (CVaR)
- Computational tools:
  - Gradient Descent and Interior Point Methods for optimization
  - Python libraries: NumPy, pandas, matplotlib

## Results
- MVO achieved higher short-term returns but exposed the portfolio to higher volatility
- Robust MVO reduced downside risk and stabilized performance under uncertainty
- Risk Parity provided the most balanced allocation across assets
- Monte Carlo simulations validated the tradeoff between return and tail risk
- Visualizations included cumulative wealth curves and comparative risk metrics

## Skills Demonstrated
- Financial optimization and portfolio theory
- Risk modeling with Monte Carlo simulation
- Python programming for numerical computation
- Data visualization of risk-return tradeoffs
